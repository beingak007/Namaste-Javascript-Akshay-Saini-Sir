6. undefined vs not defined in JS ðŸ¤”
1. Introduction to undefined in JavaScript
->undefined is very special keyword in js.
->Js engine creates global execution context and allocates memory for variables and functions even before code is written.
->undefined comes to picture in this senario.

2.Code Example of undefined in JS
eg-1:
console.log(a);  //undefined
var a=7;
console.log(a);  //7
console.log(x);  //x is not defined

->Execution context 
  memory        |    code
 a:undefined    |

->before this line get executed memory for a is allocated.
->Js reserves memory for a.
->undefined is place holder which is placed in the memory.

2.1 Accessing value of a before intializing it. it gives undefined.
->undefined is allocated by js engine before executing program.
eg-2:
console.log(a);  //undefined
var a=7;

2.2 Accessing variable x which is not defined. it gives not defined.
eg-3:
var a=7;
console.log(x);  //x is not defined

2.3 Accessing value of a it's execution
eg-4:
var a=7;
console.log(a);

=>3.  Undefined vs Not Defined
a. undefined
->it is the special keyword. it takes up it's own memory. it is a place holder kept in memory until a varaible get assigned with some other value.
->undefined is place holder which is placed in the memory.
->undefined is allocated by js engine to a before running progr
->undefined is not equal to empty.

b. Not Defined
->which has not been allocated memory.


=>4. undefined vs not defined demo using code
eg-2: a is not intialized with any value
var a;
console.log(a);  //undefined

if(a===undefined){
    console.log("a is undefined");  //a is undefined
}
else{
    console.log("a is undefined");
}

Output:
undefined
a is undefined

eg-3: a is intialized with some value
var a;
console.log(a);  //undefined
a=7; // a is defined

if(a===undefined){
    console.log("a is undefined");  
}
else{
    console.log("a is not undefined"); //a is not undefined
}

Output:
undefined
a is not undefined

5. JS is a loosely typed language a.k.a weakly typed language
->JS is losely typed language or weekly typed language.
->it does not attach it's variables to any specific data types.
->if string is given to a then after sometime it can also replaced with numbers.
eg-1 
var a;
console.log(a);
a="Ashish";
a=10;
console.log(a);

Output:
undefined
10

6. Mistake you should not make while using undefined
-> it is not good way to give undefined to a varibale.
->it may lead to lot of inconsistencies.
->undefined is meant to know wheather the variable is assigned or Not.
